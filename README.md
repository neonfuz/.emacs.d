# Neonfuz's .emacs

This is just my .emacs.d directory. The ELPA directory is omitted
because it is large, to properly use this config you will have to
install all packages that are referenced in `init.el`.

Many of the snippets are either the default yasnippet snippets, or
slightly modified ones to fit my styling.
